# Kanjeweled
remake of the popular game bejeweled

#Objective

I have always been a big fan Japanese characters (Kanji).  There is something aesthetically pleasing about them that always seems to leave me speechless, especially when watching an expert calligrapher perform their craft.

When tasked with building a copy of bejeweled, my first thought was to apply the aesthetic feel of calligraphy to the classic game.  I picked the font and borders to resemble an ink-drawn page and picked some of my favorite Kanji to take the place of the gems (with the colors of gold, silver, bronze, emerald, ruby, sapphire, and turquoise).

#Installing Kanjewled
